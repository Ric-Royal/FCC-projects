## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r eval=FALSE}
east_pop<-read_html("https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/eastern-africa-population/#:~:text=The%20current%20population%20of%20Eastern,among%20subregions%20ranked%20by%20Population.")

```
```
# Get the movie charts from wikipedia url using html_table function
east_africa <- html_table(east_pop)

east_africa[[3]]
```


# Put the safaricom shares into a data frame
east_africa_df <- data.frame(east_africa[[3]])
east_africa_df

# Numbers of rows and columns
dim(east_africa_df)

# converting data frame into a csv and saving it on the working directory
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/Rick-Royal/Documents")

write.csv(east_africa_df, "east_africa.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```

# Questions
1. Data output methods - write.csv
2. Structured data. The data is organized in rows and columns 
3. Full extraction: the data is completely extracted from the source â€“ Whatever is available, all of that is completely extracted.
4. Offline extraction: Data is not extracted from the
source system but is staged explicitly outside the
original source system.
5. The data is extracted from a website in this case kwayis.org.
The data is then Transformed from a tibble to a dataframe.
The data is then loaded onto the system by converting and saving it into a csv file.
